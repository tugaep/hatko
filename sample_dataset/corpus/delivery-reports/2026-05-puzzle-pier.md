# Delivery Report: Puzzle Pier, 2026-05

Client: Mistral Play. Target network this cycle: AppLovin. Developers: Deniz, Elif.

## QA findings and fixes

- Cta contrast fell below 4.5:1 on the client's light background; standard dark scrim applied.
- Korean line breaks split mid-word on the end card; locale-aware wrapping enabled.
- The drone searchlight flickered on speed boosts with motion blur; blend mode corrected.
- Retry after fail state occasionally skipped the tutorial hint; state machine reset fixed.

## Observations

- Size headroom on the applovin export is under 300 kb; audio changes need platform review.
- Loop_complete rate rose once the second tutorial hint was made skippable.
- Time to first interaction improved from 3.4 s to 2.6 s after asset preloading changes.

## Sign-off

Checklist attached to the delivery ticket by Deniz. Delivery review run by a developer outside the pod, per the review process. Export re-run after a size warning; final artifact within limits.
