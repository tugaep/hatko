# Delivery Report: Puzzle Pier, 2026-01

Client: Mistral Play. Target network this cycle: AppLovin. Developers: Tomas, Deniz.

## QA findings and fixes

- Retry after fail state occasionally skipped the tutorial hint; state machine reset fixed.
- Memory grew slightly after repeated loops due to retained particle pools; pools now recycled.
- Cta contrast fell below 4.5:1 on the client's light background; standard dark scrim applied.
- First_interaction arrived late on low-end android; the intro animation was trimmed by 400 ms.

## Observations

- Loop_complete rate rose once the second tutorial hint was made skippable.
- Time to first interaction improved from 3.4 s to 2.6 s after asset preloading changes.
- Fail-to-retry conversion held above 80 percent across all tested devices.
