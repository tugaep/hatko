# Delivery Report: Puzzle Pier, 2025-10

Client: Mistral Play. Target network this cycle: Meta. Developers: Elif, Dilek.

## QA findings and fixes

- Haptics fired on every match on ios which the client found excessive; reduced to combos.
- First_interaction arrived late on low-end android; the intro animation was trimmed by 400 ms.
- Orientation switch during the fail popup misplaced the retry button; layout re-anchored.
- Memory grew slightly after repeated loops due to retained particle pools; pools now recycled.

## Observations

- Loop_complete rate rose once the second tutorial hint was made skippable.
- Time to first interaction improved from 3.4 s to 2.6 s after asset preloading changes.
- Fail-to-retry conversion held above 80 percent across all tested devices.
