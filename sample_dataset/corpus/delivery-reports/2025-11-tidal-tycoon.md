# Delivery Report: Tidal Tycoon, 2025-11

Client: Tandem Toys. Target network this cycle: Unity. Developers: Elif, Baris.

## QA findings and fixes

- Haptics fired on every match on ios which the client found excessive; reduced to combos.
- Korean line breaks split mid-word on the end card; locale-aware wrapping enabled.
- Mute toggle did not persist across loops; audio state moved out of the loop scope.
- Orientation switch during the fail popup misplaced the retry button; layout re-anchored.

## Observations

- Loop_complete rate rose once the second tutorial hint was made skippable.
- Fail-to-retry conversion held above 80 percent across all tested devices.
- Time to first interaction improved from 3.4 s to 2.6 s after asset preloading changes.

## Sign-off

Checklist attached to the delivery ticket by Elif. Delivery review run by a developer outside the pod, per the review process. Export re-run after a size warning; final artifact within limits.
